## Get started

### Step one: Building the Docker image

Build the Docker container image using the following command:

```bash
./mwaa-local-env build-image
```

**Note**: it takes several minutes to build the Docker image locally.

### Step two: Running Apache Airflow

#### Local runner

Runs a local Apache Airflow environment that is a close representation of MWAA by configuration.

```bash
./mwaa-local-env start
```

To stop the local environment, Ctrl+C on the terminal and wait till the local runner and the postgres containers are stopped.

### Step three: Accessing the Airflow UI

By default, the `bootstrap.sh` script creates a username and password for your local Airflow environment.

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `test`

#### Airflow UI

- Open the Apache Airlfow UI: <http://localhost:8080/>.

The `save_data_dag.py`, `train_dag.py`, and `inference_dag.py` scripts are used for data loading, model training, and generating recommendations, respectively.
